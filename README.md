# Greenness code
A transformative step in the search for general rules governing seasonal leaf growth dynamics.

Our findings provide multiple lines of evidence for the coordination of vegetation photosynthesis physiology and structure.
Our approach is able to capture 81% of the global variations in observed seasonal leaf dynamics, thus offering a promising avenue to improve global models in a parsimonious, but theory-constrained fashion.

Time and spatial scale: We used satellite observations for the period 2001–2019 with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°. We used in situ observations during 2000–2020.
Data exclusion: For satellite data, we excluded the top 15% of cropland coverage to minimize anthropogenic impacts. For ground records, we excluded sites with less than three consecutive years of data and excluded all records from cropland sites.
